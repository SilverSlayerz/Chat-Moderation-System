# Chat-Moderation-System
The system simulates a chat management and moderation framework where different entities, such as moderator, and groups, are represented as processes. Within this system, each group process corresponds to a chat group (similar to a WhatsApp group) consisting of multiple users (also processes) who can interact with each other.
